# Tolminski Migovec Cave Exploration Project
## Survey Data Archive

These files are the survey data resulting from explorations of the
caves on the Migovec Plateau, Slovenia by JSPDT and Imperial
College Caving club over the years 1994-2012.

The data is in survex format. You can get the latest version of
survex from www.survex.com and it runs on most platforms. Since
all the data is in ascii format, it can also be ported into other
survey programs. All data is in tape - compass - clino form.
